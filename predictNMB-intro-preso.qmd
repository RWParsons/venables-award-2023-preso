`{predictNMB}`

-   User provides inputs for setting & intervention (w/ uncertainty)
-   Simulates & evaluates clinical prediction models within CDSS
-   Estimates patient benefit and healthcare costs

## Example problem and inputs required - inpatient falls {.smaller}

- Falls leads to about 0.04 lost Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)
  (Latimer et al. 2013) and has an approximate beta distribution of:
  $$\mathrm{B}(\alpha = 2.95, \beta = 32.25)$$  

- There are also additional healthcare costs of about \$6669 (Morello et
  al. 2015) and follows an approximate gamma distribution of:
  $$\Gamma (\alpha = 22.05, \beta = 0.0033) $$

- Fall prevention education…

  - has a fixed, known cost of \$77.3 per patient (Hill et al. 2015)
  - reduces probability of fall by 45% (Haines et al. 2011) - the log
    hazard ratio follows an approximate normal distribution of:
    $$\mathcal{N}(\mu = -0.844, \sigma = 0.304) $$
    

## Example problem and inputs required - inpatient falls {.smaller}

- The willingness-to-pay (WTP) for us is \$28033 AUD

- Current practice: Everyone gets the fall prevention intervention
  (treat-all approach).

Calculations and code for using details in paper cited papers above is
described in (Parsons et al. 2023). We used `{fitdistrplus}` but you can
also use a shiny app by Nicole White and Robin Blythe: `ShinyPrior`

## Objectives/Questions {.smaller}

- We have a prediction model which has an AUC of about 0.8 and we want
  to know whether it’ll be worthwhile implementing it within a CDSS to
  reduce healthcare costs (giving people that are unlikely to fall the
  intervention at \$77.3 a pop!)

- We are currently in a geriatric ward where the fall rate is about 0.1
  (1 in 10 admitted patients have a fall) but are also interested in
  implementing the same model in the acute care ward (fall rate = 0.03).
  Would we expect to make the same conclusion?

- We think we can improve the performance of the model up to 0.95 with
  some extra effort by the models - would this change our conclusion?

### Running our simulation (primary use-case)

``` r

  fx_nmb_training = training_sampler,
  fx_nmb_evaluation = validation_sampler,
  show_progress = TRUE,
  cl = cl
